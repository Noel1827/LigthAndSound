## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.udacity.com/blog/2021/04/javascript-random-numbers.html#:~:text=Javascript%20creates%20pseudo%2Drandom%20numbers,it%20will%20never%20be%201.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One challenge that I had is my inexperience with Web Development. I've never had any previous experience with HTML/CSS/Javascript before. I made some mistakes while writing code like syntax errors and function errors since I didn't know what was happening. The way I resolved that challenge was by reading carefully the instructions and opening the additional information provided to understand thoroughly what was happening and solve the errors on my code. My experience with other programming languages also helped me understand most of the topics like inheritance, functions, etc.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
What other projects can I create using Web Development? I knew that I could do websites but now I know that WebDev is more powerful than that.
How can I create my own website? We used glitch to create this project but I still don't know how to create my own website.
Can I use other languages for the backend other than javaScript? I know it's possible but I don't know how.
What skills do I need to become a better web developer?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would change the sounds to something more fun like voices of some popular characters.
